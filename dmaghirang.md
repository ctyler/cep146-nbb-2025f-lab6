The difference between a git "merge" and a pull request is that a git merge is a local git command, and a pull request happens on GitHub.  
In GitHub a pull request is a more formal way of requesting to merge one branch into another branch, and merge requires that you have both branches locally in order to merge them both.
A pull request adds a social aspect when merging as you must request for permission to merge two branches together. A git merge does not require approval at all and you merge both branches together locally on your own machine.
