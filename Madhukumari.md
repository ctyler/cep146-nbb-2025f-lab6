### Question  
**What is the difference between a git "merge" and a GitHub "pull request"?**  

- **git merge:** Combines changes from one branch into another *locally* on your computer.  
- **GitHub pull request:** Requests someone (like your professor) to review and merge your changes *on GitHub*.
