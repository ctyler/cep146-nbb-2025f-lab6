What is the difference between a git "merge" and a GitHub "pull request"?



Git's merge is a command used in a local repository to combine commits from one branch into another (for example, merging a feature branch into the main branch), and it is a local branch merging operation. GitHub's "pull request" is a request initiated on a remote repository (on the GitHub platform). It is used to ask the repository maintainer (such as your professor here) to merge the changes from your branch (usually a branch in your forked repository) into a branch of the target repository (such as your professor's original repository). It is a collaborative, remote - platform - based merge request mechanism.
