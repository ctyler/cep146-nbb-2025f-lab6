**Questions**
a. What is the difference between a git "merge" and a GitHub "pull request"?

The difference between git "merge" and Github "pull request" is that git "merge" is a command that combines changes from one branch into another locally. GitHub pull request is collaborative process where you request to merge changes, allowing for code review, discussion, and automated check before merging.
