## Q&A

**Q. What is the difference between a git "merge" and a GitHub "pull request"?**  
**A.**  
- **git merge**: A command in Git that directly combines the changes from one branch into another branch within the same repository (local or remote). When executed, it creates a merge commit or fast-forwards the branch if possible.  
- **GitHub pull request (PR)**: A feature on GitHub that lets you request to merge your branch changes into another branch (usually `main`). It is not an automatic merge â€” it allows other people to review, comment, run tests, and approve before the actual merge happens. The merge only occurs after someone clicks the **"Merge pull request"** button.
